# Pneumonia Detection using Deep Learning

### Project Overview.
Detecting the traces of pneumonia through the X-ray Images using Deep Learning Techniques. X-ray Images are extracted using the `dicomutils.py` with patient information from DICOM(Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine). End-to-End Machine learning is done in the Google Colab with relevant Markdown in the notebook itself.

**Tools and Technologies used:** Python 3, Keras, pandas, numpy, seaborn, Google Colab.
